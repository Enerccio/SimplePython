Differences from python 2.7:

Class instances:
	__init__ of instances can return non None value. If None is returned, the newly created instance is returned to the called.
	If different value than None is returned from __init__, that value is returned to caller. This is very useful when creating 
	proxies and other shenanigans. Example:
	
			class Entity(...):
				def __init__(self, ...):
					...
					if PROXY_ENABLED:
						return EntityProxy(self)
